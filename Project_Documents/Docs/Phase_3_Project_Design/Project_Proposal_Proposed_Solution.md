### Project Overview
* **Objective:** To build an authoritative, broadcast-quality Formula 1 Race Intelligence platform that transforms complex multi-season championship datasets (6,464 race outcomes, 3,814 telemetry laps) into interactive Tableau dashboards, real-time visual charts, and a high-performance web terminal.
* **Scope:** Encompasses historical and contemporary hybrid regulation cycles (2010–2026), 10 active constructor teams, 19 elite drivers, 29 world championship circuits, and 5 tire compound strategies.

### Problem Statement & Impact
* **Description:** Motorsport telemetry is traditionally siloed across massive, unwieldy tables with complex join relationships, hindering rapid strategic decision-making and preventing fans and analysts from exploring multi-dimensional race dynamics.
* **Impact:** Eliminates data opacity, shortens strategic analysis cycles from hours to seconds, and bridges the gap between raw engineering telemetry and public data storytelling.

### Proposed Solution & Methodology
* **Approach:** A modular four-tier architecture:
  1. *Ingestion & ETL Tier:* Automated Python ETL pipeline (`process_f1_dataset.py`) parsing raw workbooks and normalizing entity models.
  2. *Data Warehouse & Storage Tier:* Cloud-ready Snowflake schemas and offline-ready `data.js` objects.
  3. *Business Intelligence Tier:* Multi-panel Tableau Public dashboard and narrative story points.
  4. *Presentation & Interaction Tier:* Pure HTML5/CSS3/ES6+ web terminal in a strict Formula 1 Black & Red broadcast design system.
* **Key Features:**
  * Animated start-light gantry sequence ("Lights Out").
  * Animated SVG race circuit with real-time traveling car dot, sector markers, and DRS zone.
  * Infinite-scroll live telemetry marquee ticker.
  * Embedded Tableau Dashboard and Story frames with zero-crop fallbacks.
  * 4 interactive Chart.js graphs and 6 dataset-driven insight cards.
  * Live driver card grid with real-time search, season filters (2010–2026), and sorting.
  * Validated contact terminal with toast notifications.

### Resource Requirements
